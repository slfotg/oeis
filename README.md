# OEIS

Allows basic searching of OEIS from VSCode

## Features

Allows searching for sequences in OEIS by running the `oeis.search` command. A quick pick menu will show potential matches and clicking one of them will open that sequence in OEIS in your browser.

## Usage

Hit Ctrl+Shift+P to open command palette and search for "OEIS".

After selecting the "OEIS: Sequence Search" command, just type any sequence like you would on the oeis website.

If any sequences are found, they will be displayed in a drop down with basic information. When you select one of those items, you will be brought to the OEIS page on that sequence in your browser.

I recommend creating a key binding for the command. I'm currently using Ctrl+Alt+S.
