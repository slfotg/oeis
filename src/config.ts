See A028297 and A027113 for examples.`,

See A007318 and A003987 for examples.`,
    uned: `Not edited. The keyword "uned" indicates that this sequence needs editing. If you can help by editing the entry, please do so!`,
    unkn: `Little is known; an unsolved problem; anyone who can find a formula or recurrence is urged to add it to the entry.`,
    walk: `Counts walks (or self-avoiding paths)`,
